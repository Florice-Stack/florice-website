export const faqItems = [
  {
    question: "How do I know if my plant needs a full assessment or just a single-machine review?",
    answer:
      "Start with a single-machine review if one piece of equipment changed and recovery dropped shortly after — for example, a new whitener or polisher. A full assessment is appropriate when recovery has drifted over months, downtime is rising across multiple stages, or you are planning capex and need a baseline across the entire milling train.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can you help us choose between replacing a whitener train vs. adding a polishing stage?",
    answer:
      "Yes. We model both options against your paddy variety, target head rice percentage, and available floor space. We compare capex, power load, operator skill required, and expected recovery gain — without tying the recommendation to a specific OEM.",
  },
  {
    question: "We want to increase capacity from 8 TPH to 12 TPH. What should we plan first?",
    answer:
      "Begin with intake, cleaning, and hulling capacity — bottlenecks often appear upstream of the whitener. We review silo draw rates, elevator capacities, aspiration loads, and utility headroom before specifying new milling equipment. A phased layout plan helps you upgrade without a full shutdown.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you work with our existing equipment supplier, or do you specify independently?",
    answer:
      "We specify independently and can review proposals from your preferred suppliers. Our role is to verify that equipment capacity, installation clearance, and process fit match your grain and throughput — not to sell machines.",
  },
  {
    question: "How long does a typical plant assessment take on site?",
    answer:
      "Most rice and flour mill assessments run 3–5 days on site: one day for walk-through and data collection, one to two days for machine-level checks and operator interviews, and one day for preliminary findings. A written report with prioritized actions follows within one to two weeks.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can you support commissioning after new equipment is installed?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Commissioning support includes pre-start mechanical checks, aspiration balancing, parameter setting during run-in, operator training, and verification that recovery and downtime targets hold over the first production cycles.",
  },
  {
    question: "We are modernizing an old pneumatic conveying system. Is remote review enough to start?",
    answer:
      "Remote review works for an initial scope if you share layout drawings, duct routes, blockage history, and motor load data. On-site duct velocity measurement and cyclone inspection are usually needed before final specifications — especially on flour mill break systems where ash drift is a risk.",
  },
  {
